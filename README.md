# Service-with-REST-HTTP-interface

This is an examplary service that allows updating engines' sensors' values or returns a list of malfunctioning engines on user's demand.
REST/HTTP interface is used here.
It reads the list of all sensors from a YAML file which is located on GitHub's server 
(simply gets the link from command-line parameter when starting the server).
